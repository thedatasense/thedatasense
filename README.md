# Hi there 👋

## About Me

Machine learning researcher at Medtronic Surgical R&D | PhD candidate at University of New Haven

My research focuses on clinically robust vision-language models for diagnostic applications, specifically addressing phrasing-sensitive failures and misleading explanation effects in medical AI systems.

## 🔭 Currently working on

- PhD dissertation on clinically robust vision-language models for diagnostic reasoning
- Investigating coupled failure modes in medical VLMs using MIMIC-CXR
- Aegis: an AI-powered personal operations system integrating fitness and productivity data

## 🌱 Currently learning

- Mechanistic interpretability and causal mediation analysis in VLMs
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) for medical imaging models
- Cross-attention mechanisms in multimodal architectures

## 👯 Looking to collaborate on

- Medical AI and healthcare ML applications
- Vision-language models for clinical diagnostics
- AI safety frameworks for medical settings
